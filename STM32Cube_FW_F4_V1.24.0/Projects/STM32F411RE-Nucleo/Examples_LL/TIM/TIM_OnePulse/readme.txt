@par Example Description

This example shows how to configure a timer to generate a positive pulse in
Output Compare mode with a length of tPULSE and after a delay of tDELAY;
This example is based on the STM32F4xx TIM LL API; peripheral initialization is done
using LL unitary services functions for optimization purpose (performance and size).

The pulse is generated on OC1.

This example uses 2 timer instances:

  - TIM3 generates a positive pulse of 50 us after a delay of 50 us. User push-button
    is used to start TIM3 counter. 
                                              ___ 
                                             |   |
    User push-button ________________________|   |________________________________
                                                            ___________
                                                           |           |
    OC1              ______________________________________|           |________
    (TIM3_CH1)                                <---50 us---><---50 us--->
                                                |            |_ uwMeasuredPulseLength
                                                |_ uwMeasuredDelay

  TIM3_CH1 delay and pulse length are measured every time a pulse is generated. 
  Both can be observed through the debugger by monitoring the variables uwMeasuredDelay and
  uwMeasuredPulseLength respectively.

  - TIM2 generates a positive pulse of 3 s after a delay of 2 s. TIM2 counter start
    is controlled through the slave mode controller. TI2FP2 signals is selected as
    trigger input meaning that TIM2 counter starts when a rising edge is detected on
    TI2FP2. The TIM2 output channel is mapped on the pin PA.05 (connected to LED2 on board
    NUCLEO-F411RE). Thus LED2 status (on/off) mirrors the timer output level (active v.s. inactive).
                                  ___
                                 |   |
    TI2 _________________________|   |_________________________________________
    (TIM2_CH2)
                                               ___________________________
                                              |                           |
    OC1 ______________________________________|                           |____
    (TIM2_CH1)                   <-----2s-----><----------3 s------------->
   


Both TIM3 and TIM2 are configured to generate a single pulse (timer counter 
stops automatically at the next update event (UEV).

Connecting TIM3 OC1 to TIM2 TI2 allows to trigger TIM2 counter by pressing
the User push-button.

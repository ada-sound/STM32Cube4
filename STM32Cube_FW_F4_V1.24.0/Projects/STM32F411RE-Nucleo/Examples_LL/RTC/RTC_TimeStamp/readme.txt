@par Example Description

This example guides you through the different configuration steps by mean of LL API 
to ensure Time Stamp configuration using the RTC peripheral. Peripheral initialization 
done using LL unitary services functions for optimization purpose (performance and size).

In this example, after start-up, SYSCLK is configured to the max frequency using the PLL with
HSI as clock source.

The RTC peripheral configuration is ensured by the Configure_RTC() function 
(configure of the needed RTC resources according to the used hardware CLOCK, 
PWR, RTC clock source and BackUp). You may update this function to change RTC configuration.

@note LSI oscillator clock is used as RTC clock source by default.
      The user can use also LSE as RTC clock source. The user uncomment the adequate 
      line on the main.c file.
      @code
        #define RTC_CLOCK_SOURCE_LSI  
        /* #define RTC_CLOCK_SOURCE_LSE */
      @endcode
      LSI oscillator clock is delivered by a 32 kHz RC.
      LSE (when available on board) is delivered by a 32.768 kHz crystal.

Configure_RTC_TimeStamp() function is then called to initialize the time stamp feature 
with interrupt mode. It configures the time stamp pin to be rising edge and enables
the time stamp detection on time stamp pin.
LL_RTC_DATE_Config()and LL_RTC_TIME_Config() functions are then called to initialize the 
time and the date.

The associated firmware performs the following:
1. After start-up the program configure the RTC (Time date) and enable the feature 
   timeStamp. 

2. When applying a high level on the time stamp pin (PC.13) by pressing the User push-button, 
   a time stamp event is detected and the calendar is saved in the time stamp structures.
   Each time the user presses on the User push-button, the current date and time stamp are updated and displayed 
   on the debugger (live watch) in aShowTimeStamp and aShowDateStamp variables .
   The current time and date are updated and displayed on the debugger (live watch) in aShowTime, aShowDate variables .

- LED2 is toggling : This indicates that the system generates an error.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F411xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-F411RE board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
